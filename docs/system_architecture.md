# VisionEarth System Architecture

## Overview

VisionEarth is a real-time, interactive 3D globe platform with satellite data overlays, weather visualization, and AI-powered environmental anomaly detection. The system integrates various data sources and provides an intuitive interface for exploring Earth's environmental data.

## System Components

### 1. Frontend Layer
- **Technology**: React.js + CesiumJS
- **Responsibilities**:
  - 3D Earth visualization
  - Interactive UI for data exploration
  - Layer management for different data overlays
  - Time-based data playback
  - User authentication interface
  - Dashboard for anomaly alerts and notifications

### 2. Backend Layer
- **Technology**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Responsibilities**:
  - RESTful API endpoints for data retrieval
  - WebSocket connections for real-time updates
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Data transformation and serving
  - Cache management
  - Proxy to external data sources
  - Job scheduling for data processing

### 3. AI/ML Module
- **Technology**: Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenCV
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Satellite image processing
  - Environmental anomaly detection
  - Time-series analysis
  - Change detection algorithms
  - Feature extraction from satellite imagery
  - Model training and deployment
  - Inference API

### 4. Data Pipeline
- **Technology**: Python, Apache Airflow
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Scheduled data ingestion from external sources
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Data format conversion
  - Metadata extraction
  - Data validation
  - Storage management

### 5. Database Layer
- **Technology**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Store spatial data
  - Store time-series satellite data
  - User information and preferences
  - System configuration
  - AI model metadata and results

## Data Flow

1. Data sources (NOAA, NASA, Sentinel Hub) → Data Pipeline
2. Data Pipeline → Database
3. Raw data → AI/ML Module → Processed results → Database
4. Client requests → Backend → Database → Client
5. Real-time updates → WebSockets → Client

## Integration Points

1. **Frontend to Backend**: 
   - RESTful API calls
   - WebSocket connections for real-time updates

2. **Backend to Database**:
   - SQL queries via SQLAlchemy ORM
   - Spatial queries via PostGIS

3. **Backend to AI Module**:
   - REST API calls to AI service endpoints
   - Shared storage for large data transfers

4. **Data Pipeline to External Sources**:
   - HTTP/FTP clients for data retrieval
   - API clients for specific data providers

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment
- Local Docker containers for each component
- Local Kubernetes cluster for integration testing

### Production Environment
- Kubernetes-based deployment on cloud provider (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Container orchestration for scalability
- Load balancing for backend services
- CDN for static frontend assets
- Managed database service
- Object storage for raw data
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure

## Scaling Considerations

1. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - Stateless backend services can scale horizontally
   - Worker pools for AI processing tasks
   - Database read replicas for query-heavy workloads

2. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Redis for frequent data queries
   - CDN for static assets
   - In-memory caching for computation results

3. **Data Partitioning**:
   - Temporal partitioning for time-series data
   - Spatial partitioning for geographic data
   - Sharding strategy for very large datasets

## Security Architecture

1. **Authentication**: JWT-based with refresh tokens
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control
3. **Data Encryption**: TLS for data in transit, encryption at rest
4. **API Security**: Rate limiting, CORS, input validation
5. **Infrastructure Security**: VPC, security groups, least privilege principle

## Future Extensibility

The modular architecture allows for:
- Adding new data sources with minimal changes
- Integrating new AI/ML models
- Supporting additional visualization layers
- Implementing user collaboration features
- Mobile application integration
